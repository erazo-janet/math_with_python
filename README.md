Hello there! This is my collection of python scripts for solving mathematic problems. I graduated from the University of California, Riverside with a bachelors degree in Applied Mathematics, and I have a passion for solving mathematic problems by programming. Here, you can find how you can use math in python. Python has an extensive math module that allows us to perform mathematical tasks.
